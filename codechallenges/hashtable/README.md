# Hashtable (Hashmaps) Implementation

## Challenge Description

Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

- `add`: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- `get`: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- `contains`: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- `hash`: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency

- The challenge was solved using `Node` class, `Linked List`, and a `Hashmap` class.

### Big O

- Time Complexity:
  O(n)

- Space Complexity:
  O(1)
