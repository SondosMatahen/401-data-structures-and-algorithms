# Stacks and Queues

# Challenge
Implement the queue functionality (enqueue and dequeue) using two stacks with (pop, push, and peek) methods.

# Approach & Efficiency
### Approach:

using classes, loops, and conditional statements

### Efficiency (Big O Notaion):

- Space complexity:
  - `enqueue` method => O(n)
  - `dequeue` method => O(1)
- Time complexity:
   - `enqueue` method => O(n)
   - `dequeue` method => O(1) 

# Whiteboard:
